        <h2>Hyundai Elantra</h2>
        <div class="auto">
                The Hyundai Elantra or Hyundai Avante (Korean: 현대 아반떼), is a compact car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 1990. The 
                Elantra was initially marketed as the Lantra in Australia and some European markets. In Australia, this was due to the similarly named Mitsubishi 
                Magna Elante model; similarly, in other markets, the name Avante is not used due to its similarity with Audi's "Avant" designation, which is used 
                for their line of station wagons. The name Elantra is derived from the English words elite and luxurious.
