    <h3>About India</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; text-shadow:">India has a unique culture and is one of the oldest and greatest civilizations of the world. India has achieved all-round socio-economic
         progress since its Independence. India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the 
         tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is
         by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches
         southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the
         west.</p><br>

         <h3>Geography of India</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The geological regions broadly follow
         the physical features, and may be grouped into three regions: the Himalayas and their associated group of mountains, the Indo-Ganga Plain,
         and the Peninsular Shield.The Himalayan mountain belt to the north and the Naga-Lushai mountain in the east, are the regions of
         mountain-building movement. Most of this area, now presenting some of the most magnificent mountain scenery in the world, was under marine
         conditions about 600 million (60 crore) years ago. In a series of mountain-building movements commencing about 70 million (7 crore) years 
         ago, the sediments and the basement rocks rose to great heights. The weathering and erosive elements worked on these to produce the relief
         seen today. The Indo-Ganga plains are a great alluvial tract that separates the Himalayas in the north from the Peninsula in the south.
         The Peninsula is a region of relative stability and occasional seismic disturbances. Highly metamorphosed rocks of the earliest periods, 
         dating back as far as 380 crore years, occur in the area; the rest being covered by the coastal-bearing Gondwana formations, lava flows 
         belonging to the Deccan Trap formation and younger sediments.</p><br>

    <h3>Rivers of India</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;text-align: justify; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
         The rivers of India can be classified into four groups viz., Himalayan rivers, Deccan rivers, Coastal rivers, and Rivers of the inland 
         drainage basin.The main Himalayan river systems are those of the Indus and the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna system. The Indus, which is one of
         the great rivers of the world, rises near Mansarovar in Tibet and flows through India, and thereafter through Pakistan, and finally falls 
         in the Arabian Sea near Karachi. Its important tributaries flowing in Indian Territory are the Sutlej (originating in Tibet), the Beas, 
         the Ravi, the Chenab, and the Jhelum. The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna is another important system of which the principal sub-basins are those
         of Bhagirathi and the Alaknanda, which join at Dev Prayag to form the Ganga. It traverses through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, 
         and West Bengal. Below Rajmahal hills, the Bhagirathi, which used to be the main course in the past, takes off, while the Padma continues 
         eastward and enters Bangladesh. The Yamuna, the Ramganga, the Ghaghra, the Gandak, the Kosi, the Mahananda and the Sone are the important 
         tributaries of the Ganga. Rivers Chambal and Betwa are the important sub-tributaries, which join Yamuna before it meets the Ganga. 
         The Padma and the Brahmaputra join inside Bangladesh, and continue to flow as the Padma or Ganga. The Brahmaputra rises in Tibet, 
         where it is known as Tsangpo and runs a long distance till it crosses over into India in Arunachal Pradesh under the name of Dihang. 
         Near Passighat, the Debang and Lohit join the river Brahmaputra and the combined river runs all along the Assam valley. It crosses into 
         Bangladesh downstream of Dhubri.</p><br><br>

    <h3>National Flag of India</h3>

    <p style= "text-align: justify; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
         The National Flag of India is a horizontal tricolor of deep saffron (kesaria) at the top, white in the middle, and dark green at the bottom 
         in equal proportion. The ratio of the width of the flag to its length is two to three. In the center of the white band is a navy-blue wheel 
         which represents the chakra. Its design is that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. Its diameter 
         approximates to the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes. The design of the National Flag of India was adopted by India's constituent 
         assembly on 22nd July 1947. The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya. The National Flag of India was hoisted for the first time on August 7, 
         1906, at Parsee Bagan Square in Calcutta. The flag was hoisted by Sachindra Prasad Bose and his companions. The first version of the flag 
         had a spinning wheel in the center. The flag was later modified to the present version. The National Flag of India was adopted in its present 
         form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, a few days before India's independence from the British on 15 August 
         1947. It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950 and that of the Republic of India 
         thereafter.</p><br><br><br>

    <h3>National Emblem of India</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\Shreyash\Downloads/National-Emblem.png" alt="National Emblem of India" style="width: 20%; height: auto; margin-right: 10px; float: left;">
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
         The National Emblem of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath. It was adopted on 26 January 1950, the day that 
         India became a republic. The emblem features four Asiatic lions standing back to back, symbolizing power, courage, confidence, and pride. 
         However, only three lions are visible in the emblem, as the fourth is hidden from view. The lions are mounted on a circular abacus, which 
         is girded by four smaller animalsâ€”guardians of the four directions: the lion of the north, the elephant of the east, the horse of the south, 
         and the bull of the west. The abacus rests on a lotus in full bloom, exemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration. The words
         'Satyameva Jayate' (Truth Alone Triumphs) are inscribed below the abacus in Devanagari script.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h3>Currency of India</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\Shreyash\Downloads/national currency.jpg" alt="Currency of India" style="width: 22%; height: auto; margin-right: 10px; float: left;">

         The symbol of Indian Rupee typifies India's international identity for money transactions and economic strength. The Indian Rupee sign is an 
         allegory of Indian ethos. The symbol is an amalgam of Devanagari "Ra" and the Roman Capital "R" with two parallel horizontal stripes running 
         at the top representing the national flag and also the "equal to" sign. The Indian Rupee sign was adopted by the Government of India on 
         15th July, 2010. The symbol, conceptualised and designed by Udaya Kumar, a post graduate in Design from Indian Institute of Technology 
         Bombay, has been chosen from thousands of concept entries received by the Ministry of Finance through an open competition among resident 
         Indian nationals. The process of establishing and implementing this new identity is underway through various digital technology and 
         computer applications.Historically, the rupee was a silver coin. This had severe consequences in the nineteenth century when the strongest
         economies in the world were on the gold standard (that is, paper linked to gold). The discovery of large quantities of silver in the 
         United States and several European colonies caused the panic of 1873 which resulted in a decline in the value of silver relative to gold, 
         devaluing India's standard currency. This event was known as "the fall of the rupee". In Britain War, the Long Depression resulted in 
         bankruptcies, escalating unemployment, a halt in public works, and a major trade slump that lasted until 1897</p>
